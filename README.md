# SSD_CNN_LSTM
Semantic Similarity Detection task using CNN and LSTM

Semantic Similarity Detection (SSD) holds significance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, including Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), Question-Answering, and Information Retrieval. Our system integrates CNN and LSTM structures to effectively analyze, identify, and preserve pertinent information within sentences and across entire sentences. Leveraging local context proves beneficial in obtaining additional information about words in a sentence, thereby enhancing sentence analysis. Through our experiments, the inclusion of local context has resulted in improved prediction of sentence similarity, characterized by a reduction in mean squared error and an augmentation of correlation scores.

To run the code in Google Colab, you just need to upload data files and change some paths.
